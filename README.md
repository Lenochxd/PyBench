# PyBench

Easy Python Benchmarking.

Do you need to compare computers/servers for Python hosting or different versions of Python? This tool is perfect for you!

This tool generates a random image, a graph, and Pi to gauge the computing speed of the computer, providing you with a score for easy comparison.

## Usage

1. Make sure to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Install Python here") installed.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the benchmark: `python PyBench.py`

### Note

The file [NUMWORKS-PyBench_operations-only.py](https://my.numworks.com/python/81lennoch/numworks_pybench_operations) is a version made for Numworks calculators. Despite having fewer operations to perform, it provides equal scores as other versions.
